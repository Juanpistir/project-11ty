**I'm trying to set up the new layouts directory that was released in v0.8.0 but am hitting an issue. Here's how I've set things up**:

I added layouts to my .eleventy.js file, following the new docs
I moved my layouts out of /_includes/layouts/ and into /_layouts/
I changed all references to layouts in front-matter and directory config files to layout: layouts/base to layout: base
There was no reference to number 3 in the layout docs so I assume this is correct and the layout key just carries over from how it used to be.

Anyway, with that setup, I'm I'm getting this when I run eleventy to build the site:

Problem writing Eleventy templates: (full stack in DEBUG output)
